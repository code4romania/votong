The VotONG platform is a redeployment of a previous Code for Romania application, [RoHelp](https://github.com/code4romania/ro-help). The current code base is modified in order to serve a different purpose, namely allowing the representatives of NGOs and Associations within the Civic Society to nominate candidates and vote for them in several rounds of elections.

The vote implemented here is non-secret and is visible to the technical administrators of the platform. This codebase should not be used for any purpose that requires secret vote, not any purpose that requires a zero trust system.

## Contributing

This project is built by amazing volunteers and you can be one of them! Here's a list of ways in [which you can contribute to this project](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you want to make any change to this repository, please **make a fork first**.

Help us out by testing this project in the [staging environment](INSERT_LINK_HERE). If you see something that doesn't quite work the way you expect it to, open an Issue. Make sure to describe what you _expect to happen_ and _what is actually happening_ in detail.

If you would like to suggest new functionality, open an Issue and mark it as a __[Feature request]__. Please be specific about why you think this functionality will be of use. If you can, please include some visual description of what you would like the UI to look like, if you are suggesting new UI elements.

## Built With

* Django
* Bulma

### Programming languages

* Python (3.6+)

### Platforms

* Web

### Frontend framework

None. Includes Bulma for stilying.

### Package managers

* Pip

### Database technology & provider

* PostgreSQL

### Pre-requisites

In order to run the project locally, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

### Initial set-up

Initialize the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Check the `.env` file and see if there are any environment variables that you might need to provide a value for or change. This file is used by `docker-compose` to pass the environment variables to the container it creates.

### Starting the project

Get the project up and running:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to access the local environment site and admin at the following URLs:

- <http://localhost:8000/>
- <http://localhost:8000/admin/>

Some dummy data is loaded automatically when starting the containers for the first time.

You can access the admin with email `admin@example.test` and password `secret` (all automatically created users in the dev environment have the password set to `secret`).

If you have problems starting the project, first check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/code4romania/votong/wiki/FAQ) and if that doesn't work, ask someone from the project's channel.
Maybe the issue you just had is worth adding to the [FAQ](https://github.com/code4romania/votong/wiki/FAQ), wouldn't it?

To work on running containers that were started using `docker-compose up`, open another terminal and:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
docker-compose exec web bash
```

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to run `make lint` before commiting your code in order to format the code properly. Thank you!

## Deployment

Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
4. API references

Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.

## Production

A few steps need to be done after deploying to production:

```bash
# apply any new database migrations
$ ./manage.py migrate
# this will add any missing groups, flags (disabled by default) or email templates
$ ./manage.py init
# process static files
$ ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**NOTE** After the first deployment go into admin and edit the site data in `/admin/sites/site/` with the correct name and domain. This is used in the site and in email templates.
