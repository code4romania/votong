As they can store user preferences and navigation history, both from a specific website and for a broad selection of sites, cookies can be used as a form of spyware. Many anti-spyware products know this and constantly mark cookies to be deleted as part of anti-virus or anti-spyware scans." %}</p>

Because cookies are used to constantly transmit information both ways between the browser and the website, unauthorised persons looking to compromise your security may intercept the information contained by cookies. Although this is very rare it can happen if your browser accesses the website by using an unencrypted network (e.g. an unsecured Wifi network)." %}</p>
                <p>{% trans "Other cookie-based attacks use wrong cookie settings on servers. If a website does not ask the browser to use encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick browsers into  sending information via unencrypted channels. Attackers then use this information to access unauthorised websites. It is very important to take great care in choosing the right methods of protecting your personal information." %}</p>

If cookies are not a problem for you and you are the only person using that device you can set long cookie retention intervals in order to store your browsing history and your personal access data. If you share the device or computer you may want to set up the browser to delete your individual browsing data every time it is closed. This is one way to access websites that place cookies on your shared computer while deleting all your browsing data when closing the session." %}</li>

These apps prevent the browser from accessing websites that might exploit the browser’s vulnerabilities or download dangerous software. Ensure your browser is up-to-date. Many cookie-based attacks exploit the weak points of old browser versions." %}</p>
