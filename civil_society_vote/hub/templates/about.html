Fortunately the NGO sector is on the front lines of the battle against the effects of the epidemic; from covering gaps in the health system to creating or supplementing response capacity for the public sector or offering support to those most vulnerable, Romanian NGOs, both small and large, have been vital in protecting each and everyone of us." %}

By integrating the  Netopia payment processor with the platform, Rohelp.ro helps participating eligible organizations directly collect the resources they need, with no hidden fees or middlemen. NGOs can also request and receive material or volunteer resources directly through the platform. The needs of every organization on the platform can be seen according to how stringent the need is and where the organization is located." %}

                        “There is no uniform distribution of resources” is the 19th issue identified in Code for Romania’s own <a href="{{ link }}" target="{{ target }}" rel="{{ rel }}">2019-2020 Civic Labs year 1</a> research paper in the field of Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Management in the case of a major earthquake. In brief, starting from the analysis of the response in the case of Mexico or Italy, two countries that have had to manage response to a major earthquake recently (2017 and 2016, respectively) we realized that any fundraising effort during or after a major disaster comes together with a multitude of risks, including the sudden appearance of phantom organizations or focusing aid to just a few areas of intervention,, either thematic or geographical, according to the communication capacity of  NGOs in the field.
